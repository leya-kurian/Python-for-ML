# A Study of Participant Segmentation in Intel Certification Courses based on Satisfaction Levels

## Introduction:
Feedback analysis is pivotal in understanding participant satisfaction and preferences, particularly in educational settings like Intel Certification courses. By scrutinizing feedback, we can discern patterns that offer insights into areas of improvement, ultimately enhancing the learning experience. In this study, we aim to segment participants based on their satisfaction levels to glean deeper insights from their feedback.

## Methodology:
Our methodology integrates exploratory data analysis (EDA) with machine learning techniques to achieve our objective.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
We commenced our analysis by loading and preparing the dataset, followed by an exploration of key attributes such as 'Resource Person', 'Content Quality', 'Effectiveness', 'Expertise', 'Relevance', and 'Overall Organization'. We utilized visualizations, including count plots, pie charts, and box plots, to comprehend the distribution of feedback across different attributes and their correlation with participant satisfaction.

### Machine Learning Model - K-means Clustering:
To further explore participant segmentation, we employed K-means clustering, a widely-used unsupervised learning technique. After preprocessing the data by standardizing input attributes, we utilized the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters. Grid Search Cross Validation was then employed to fine-tune hyperparameters. Subsequently, we applied K-means clustering to assign cluster labels to participants based on their feedback patterns.

## EDA:
Our exploratory analysis yielded valuable insights into participant feedback distributions and their relationships with various attributes. We observed diverse perceptions across different resource persons and identified areas of strength and improvement based on feedback ratings.

## Machine Learning Model to Study Segmentation:
Applying K-means clustering facilitated the segmentation of participants into distinct groups based on their satisfaction levels. By visualizing the clusters and scrutinizing cluster characteristics, we gained a deeper understanding of participant segments and their corresponding feedback patterns.

## Results and Conclusion:
Through our analysis, we successfully segmented Intel Certification course participants based on their satisfaction levels, providing actionable insights for course enhancement. By comprehending participant preferences and addressing areas of improvement, future sessions can be customized to better meet participant expectations, ultimately leading to an enriched learning experience and heightened satisfaction levels.

By amalgamating EDA with machine learning, we offer a robust framework for comprehensively analyzing participant feedback and driving continuous improvement in educational offerings such as Intel Certification courses.
