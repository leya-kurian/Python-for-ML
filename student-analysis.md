# Report on Gender, Parent Survey Response, and Student Absence Analysis
</br>

## Introduction:
This report presents an exploratory analysis of a dataset containing information about students, focusing on gender distribution, parent survey responses, and student absence days. The dataset aims to provide insights into the educational landscape, aiding educational institutions in understanding and addressing various aspects of student demographics and engagement.

## Data Overview:
The dataset, termed "df_class," is sourced from a CSV file ("KMEANS_SAMPLE.csv") and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. It encompasses several attributes, including gender, parent survey responses, and student absence days, represented as categorical variables. The dataset's dimensions are examined to understand its size and structure.

## Gender Distribution Analysis:
Visualizations are employed to analyze the gender distribution within the dataset. Utilizing both bar plots and pie charts, the frequency and proportion of each gender category are illustrated. Insights derived from the analysis reveal the gender distribution's composition and balance within the dataset.

```python
# Gender Distribution Analysis
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

# Bar plot
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.countplot(x='gender', data=df_class)
plt.title("Gender Distribution", fontsize=20, color='Brown', pad=20)

# Pie chart
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
df_class['gender'].value_counts().plot.pie(explode=[0.1, 0.1], autopct='%1.2f%%', shadow=True)
plt.title("Gender Distribution", fontsize=20, color='Brown', pad=20)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
</br>

## Parent Survey Response Analysis:
Similarly, parent survey responses are analyzed using visualizations to depict the frequency and proportion of different response categories. Bar plots and pie charts are utilized to provide insights into the distribution of parental engagement with the survey.

```python
# Parent Survey Response Analysis
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

# Bar plot
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.countplot(x='ParentAnsweringSurvey', data=df_class)
plt.title("ParentAnsweringSurvey Distribution", fontsize=20, color='Brown', pad=20)

# Pie chart
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
df_class['ParentAnsweringSurvey'].value_counts().plot.pie(explode=[0.1, 0.1], autopct='%1.2f%%', shadow=True)
plt.title("ParentAnsweringSurvey", fontsize=20, color='Brown', pad=20)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
</br>

## Student Absence Days Analysis:
Lastly, the distribution of student absence days is examined through visualizations. Bar plots and pie charts provide insights into the frequency and proportion of different absence day categories, shedding light on student attendance patterns.
```python
# Student Absence Days Analysis
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

# Bar plot
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.countplot(x='StudentAbsenceDays', data=df_class)
plt.title("StudentAbsenceDays analysis", fontsize=20, color='Brown', pad=20)

# Pie chart
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
df_class['StudentAbsenceDays'].value_counts().plot.pie(explode=[0.1, 0.1], autopct='%1.2f%%', shadow=True)
plt.title("StudentAbsenceDays", fontsize=20, color='Brown', pad=20)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, the exploratory analysis of gender distribution, parent survey responses, and student absence days provides valuable insights into the dataset's characteristics. Understanding these patterns is essential for educational institutions to tailor interventions and strategies to improve educational outcomes and student engagement. Further analysis and refinement of the dataset could yield deeper insights and inform evidence-based decision-making in educational settings.
